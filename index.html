    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="inline">
        <p>In an honorable show of unity, both SAG-AFTRA and WGA have undertaken a historic strike against major production companies, demanding humane working conditions and equitable, livable compensation. As industry professionals take a courageous stand for their rights, large corporations such as Amazon/MGM, Apple, Disney/ABC/Fox, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount/CBS, Sony, and Warner Bros. Discovery (HBO) have sought to undermine the movement by <i>enlisting influencers to promote their projects, attend red carpets, and other events.</i><br><br><strong>Influencers bear a crucial responsibility to oppose large, exploitative corporations and unite in solidarity with writers, actors, and other creatives in the film industry.</strong> Together, we must declare loudly and in one voice that <strong>we unequivocally stand proudly in solidarity with the ongoing labor movements and that corporate greed does not supersede humanity.</strong> By signing below and agreeing not to post on behalf of any struck work, you actively stand against exploitative film executives and show your support for workers' rights.</p>

      <p>Even if you don't have a big platform, using your voice as a fan or follower has just as much power! Encourage the creators you follow to sign onto the Solidarity Pledge, cease posting about struck work, and stand with striking workers.</p>
      <p class="title">Donate to Strike Funds</p>
      <p>Production companies have made it clear that humanity is on the backburner, claiming "[their] endgame is to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses," calling this a "a cruel but necessary evil" <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/writers-strike-hollywood-studios-deal-fight-wga-actors-1235434335/" target="_blank">(Deadline)</a>. This cannot stand, and striking workers need our help to stay afloat during the strikes.</p>
